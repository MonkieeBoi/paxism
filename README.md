# (P)ractice Axis (M)ath

Small tool to generate a random stronghold coords and blind coords then show the
axis angles. To use this program, compile and run. To show new information, the
old information is hidden to mimic real runs.

## Usage

1. After running the program, the first angle measurement and corresponding
   chunk line is shown
2. Press any key to show the 2nd angle measurement
3. Again press any key to show the chunk coordinates, major direction and
   whether its neg x pos x or whatever
4. Finally press any key to show all the previous information and the stronghold
   coords in the nether. Since one chunk, no f3+c axis isn't very accurate it is
   expected that the calculated will differ however you should be pretty close
5. After the check screen you can press esc or q to quit or press any key to
   restart with a new stronghold

You can set the environment variables F3 and sheetless to switch to 2 dp of precision like with F3+C and to travel 28 blocks instead of 16 to do sheetless instead.
